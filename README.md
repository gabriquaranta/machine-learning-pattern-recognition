# Machine Learning And Pattern Recognition

The course aims at providing a solid introduction to **machine learning**, a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the development of algorithms able to extract knowledge from data, with a focus on pattern recognition and classification problems.

The course will cover the basic concepts of statistical machine learning and will concentrate on the broad class of **generative linear Gaussian models** and **discriminative classifiers based on logistic regression** and **support vector machines**.

The objective of the course is to provide the students with solid theoretical bases that will allow them to select, apply and evaluate different classification methods on real tasks.

The course will also allow the students to acquire the required competencies to devise novel approaches based on the frameworks that will be presented during the classes.
